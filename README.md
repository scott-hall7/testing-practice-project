# Testing Practice Project

- Implementing tests for various js functions found [here.](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice)
- This is part of The Odin Project Curriculum.
## Features

Implementing tests for the following functions:

- `capitalize` function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized
- `reverseString` function that takes a string and returns it reversed
- `calculator` object that contains functions for the basic operations: `add`, `subtract`, `divide`, and `multiply`. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation
- `caesarCipher` function that takes a string and returns it with each character “shifted”
- `analyzeArray` function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: `average`, `min`, `max`, and `length`
